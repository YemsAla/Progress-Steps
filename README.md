# Progress Steps Build

###### This was built as practice for learning javascript as a language. My learning includes variable creation, if statements and adding event listeners

## **Deployment**

I deployed the project on Github pages using the following steps:

- From the project's Repository, go to the "Settings" tab (gear icon in the top right).
- Look at the menu on the left. From the left-hand menu options, select the "Pages" tab.
- Select the "Main" branch from under the "Source" section dropdown and click "Save".
- After a few minutes, a message will display to indicate a successful deployment and provide a "Live Link".
